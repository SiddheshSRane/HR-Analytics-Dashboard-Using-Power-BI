# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI
🚀 Unleashing Insights with HR Analytics Dashboards

📥 Data Preparation The journey begins by gathering relevant data and understanding business requirements. For this project, we worked with a sample dataset in Excel format. After installing Power BI Desktop, we imported the data by selecting the appropriate csv file type and loading the tables, giving us a connected dataset to analyze.

🛠️ Data Transformation With the raw data imported, we embarked on a crucial data transformation process. Key steps included removing irrelevant columns, eliminating duplicate values, using find and replace techniques, changing data types, and inserting new conditional columns – all to ensure our data was clean and analysis-ready.

📈 Visualizations and Insights With properly modeled data, we could now visualize it effectively and uncover valuable insights:
